abstract = {The growth in traffic increased the pressure on the environmental sustainability of air transport. In this context,
many research effort has been devoted to minimise the environmental impact in the different phases
of flight. Continuous descent operations, ideally performed with the engines at idle from the cruise altitude
to right before landing, have shown to reduce fuel, noise nuisance and gaseous emissions if compared to
conventional descents. However, this type of operations suffer from a well known drawback: the loss of
predictability from the air traffic control point of view in terms of overfly times at the different waypoints
of the route. Due to this loss of predictability, air traffic controllers require large separation buffers, thus
reducing the capacity of the airport.
Previous works investigating this issue showed that the ability to meet a controlled time of arrival
at a metering fix could enable continuous descent operations while simultaneously maintaining airport
throughput. In this context, the planning and guidance functions of state-of-the-art flight management
systems need to be modernised. On-board trajectory planners capable to generate an optimal trajectory
plan satisfying time constraints introduced during the flight are seldom, mainly because the real-time optimisation
of aircraft trajectories is still elusive. Furthermore, the time scale and spatial resolution of the
wind forecasts used by these trajectory planners are far from being adequate to generate accurate flight
time predictions. Finally, there exist guidance strategies capable to accurately comply with time constraints
enforced at a certain fix in the trajectory plan, yet they are not specifically designed to minimise the
environmental impact.
This PhD thesis aims at investigating fast optimisation techniques to enable real-time updates of the
optimal trajectory plan subject to time constraints during the descent; wind networking concepts to generate
more accurate and up-to-date wind forecasts and, consequently, time predictions; and more robust an
efficient guidance strategies to reduce the environmental impact at the maximum extent while complying
with the time constraints of the trajectory plan.
First, the feasible time window at a metering fix that could be achieved during a descent requiring
neither thrust nor speed brakes usage is quantified as a function of the aircraft states (altitude, distance to
the metering fix and airspeed), aiming to assess the feasibility of guidance strategies that take advantage of
time and energy management concepts. Then, the performance of four of these guidance strategies is compared
in terms of environmental impact mitigation and ability to satisfy operational constraints. Results
from the comparison reveal that model predictive control, a strategy based on a frequent re-calculation of
the optimal trajectory plan during the execution of the descent, is the most robust in terms of energy and
time deviation at the metering fix, providing at the same time excellent environmental impact mitigation
figures. However, the execution time required to solve a rigorous trajectory optimisation problem at each
re-calculation instant remains a critical limitation for practical applications. In order to address this issue,
a variant of the model predictive control strategy that allows for fast updates of the optimal trajectory plan
based on parametric sensitivities is proposed, which shows analogous results yet halving the time needed
to update the optimal trajectory plan. Finally, the potential benefits of using wind observations broadcast by nearby aircraft to reconstruct the wind profile downstream right before updating the optimal trajectory plan when using model predictive control is also investigated. Promising results show that the combination of model predictive control with wind networking concepts could enable optimal descents without degrading the capacity of the airport.},

abstract = {The uncertainty of the takeoff time is a major contribution to the loss of trajectory predictability. At present, the Estimated TakeOff Time (ETOT) for each individual flight is extracted from the Enhanced Traffic Flow Management System (ETFMS) messages, which are sent each time there is an event triggering a recalculation of the flight data by the Network Manager Operations Centre. However, aircraft do not always takeoff at the ETOTs reported by the ETFMS due to several factors, including congestion and bad weather conditions at the departure airport, reactionary delays and air traffic flow management slot improvements. This paper presents two machine learning models that take into account several of these factors to improve the takeoff time prediction of individual flights one hour before their estimated off-block time. Predictions performed by the model trained on three years of historical flight and weather data show a reduction on the takeoff time prediction error of about 30{\%} as compared to the ETOTs reported by the ETFMS.},

abstract = {The runway configuration of an airport is the combination of runways that are active for arrivals and departures at any time. The runway configuration has a major influence on the capacity of the airport, taxiing times, the occupation of parking stands and taxiways, as well as on the management of traffic in the airspace surrounding the airport. The runway configuration of a given airport may change several times during the day, depending on the weather, air traffic demand and noise abatement rules, among other factors. This paper proposes an encoder-decoder model that is able to predict the future runway configuration sequence of an airport several hours upfront. In contrast to typical rule-based approaches, the proposed model is generic enough to be applied to any airport, since it only requires the past runway configuration history and the forecast traffic demand and weather in the prediction horizon. The performance of the model is assessed for the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport using three years of traffic, weather and runway use data.},

abstract = {The ability to meet a controlled time of arrival during a continuous descent operation will enable environmentally friendly and fuel efficient descent operations while simultaneously maintaining airport throughput. However, if the wind forecast used to compute the initial trajectory plan is not accurate enough, the guidance system will need to correct time deviations from the plan during the execution of the descent. Previous work proposed an on-board guidance strategy based on model predictive control, which repeatedly updates the trajectory plan in real-time from the current aircraft state and for the remainder of the descent. However, the wind conditions downstream, at altitudes not explored yet, were difficult to predict due to the lack of data. This paper shows the potential benefits of using wind observations, broadcast by nearby aircraft, to reconstruct the wind profile downstream. The wind profile in the trajectory optimization problem is modeled as a spline, which control points are updated to fit the observations before re-planning the trajectory. Results from simulations using realistic wind data show that the performance of model predictive control significantly improves when including up-to-date wind observations, in terms of time and energy errors at the metering fix and fuel consumption.},

abstract = {Aiming to a more collaborative demand and capacity balancing (DCB), in the scope of trajectory based operations, this paper presents an approach that takes alternative trajectories into a DCB optimization algorithm. These alternative trajectories are generated by the airspace users for those flights traversing hotspots (i.e. sectors with demand above capacity), which are predicted by the Network Manager. The trajectories consider lateral re-routings and/or vertical avoidance of all detected hotspots, which, along with different types of delay measures (including linear holding and in-flight delay recovery), are then integrated as a whole into a centralized optimization model to manage the traffic flow under a set of static scheme of airspace capacities. The combination of trajectory options and distribution of delays are hence optimized with the objective of minimizing the total deviation with regard to airspace users' preferences (taking into account the fuel consumption, route charge and the cost of delay). Results suggest that delays can be remarkably reduced once alternative trajectory options are included in the DCB algorithm. Nevertheless, this delay reduction is obtained by diverting a large number of flights, yielding to an interesting trade-off between environmental impact and cost-efficiency for the airspace users.},

This paper assesses the accuracy of a method capable of producing aircraft fuel estimates based on their 4D trajectory and the weather forecast. Fuel consumption estimates generated for 2448 descents are compared with the flight data recorder (FDR) values provided by the airline. Fuel consumption is estimated by taking the 4D trajectory from two different sources: the FDR system itself and surveillance radar tracks. In both cases, the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) and a model that fits manufacturers' performance data to polynomial functions are used to represent aircraft performance. Results obtained with the later show that fuel usage could be estimated with an accuracy of 16 kg (4.8{\%}) by using the 4D trajectory as reported by the FDR system and 28 kg (7.8{\%}) by using surveillance radar observations. It is also observed that the BADA 3.6 model underestimates the fuel consumption, illustrating the need for an improved performance model in the terminal manoeuvring area.},

A TEMO descent aims to achieve an energy-managed idle-thrust continuous descent operation (CDO) while satisfying ATC time constraints, to maintain runway throughput. An optimal descent plan is calculated with an advanced on-board real-time aircraft trajectory optimisation algorithm considering forecasted weather and aircraft performance. The optimised descent plan was executed using the speed-on-elevator mode of an experimental Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system connected to the pitch servo motor of the Cessna Citation II aircraft. Several TEMO conceptual variants have been flown. It has been demonstrated that the TEMO concept enables arrival with timing errors below 10 seconds.

A multiphase optimal control problem is formulated and solved by means of numerical methods.

Considering that for short-haul flights the climb and descent phases usually account for a considerable percentage of the total trip distance, this paper extends previous works on speed reduction in cruise to the whole flight. A trajectory optimization software is used to compute the maximum airborne delay (or linear holding) that can be performed without extra fuel consumption if compared with the nominal flight. Three cases are studied: speed reduction only in cruise; speed reduction in the whole flight, but keeping the nominal cruise altitude; and speed reduction for the whole flight while also optimizing the cruise altitude to maximize delay. Three representative flights have been simulated, showing that the airborne delay increases significantly in the two last cases with nearly 3-fold time for short-haul flights and 2-fold for mid-hauls with the first case. Results also show that fuel and time are traded along different phases of flight in such a way the airborne delay is maximized while the total fuel burn is kept constant.},

In this work, we introduce an early prototype of an ATM simulator, focusing on air traffic flow management at strategic, pre-tactical and tactical levels, which allows the calculation of safety and efficiency indicators for optimized trajectories, both at individual and network level. The software architecture of the simulator, relying on a HPC cluster of computers, has been preliminary tested with a set of flights whose trajectory vertical profiles have been optimized according to two different concepts of operations: conventional cruise operations (i.e. flying at constant altitudes and according to the flight levels scheme rules) and continuous climb cruise operations (i.e., optimizing the trajectories with no vertical constraints). The novel ATM simulator has been tested to show preliminary benchmarking results between these two concepts of operations. The simulator here presented can contribute as a testbed to evaluate the potential benefits of future Trajectory Based Operations and to understand the complex relationships among the different ATM key performance areas.},

The assessment has been performed for Barcelona El Prat airport (Spain), using arrival traffic for several representative days gathered from historical data. The earliest and latest trajectories at a metering fix for each inbound aircraft have been computed assuming engine-idle CDOs. Given the attainable RTA window for each aircraft, the feasibility of sequencing the arrival traffic with RTAs has been assessed by solving an aircraft sequencing problem. Results show that low traffic scenarios could be properly managed by only assigning RTAs. For certain scenarios, however, with high traffic loads and late RTA assignments, radar vectoring would still be necessary. The distance from the runway where inbound aircraft are expeced to receive the RTA has been also subject of study, demonstrating that the assignment of RTAs well before starting the descent would favor to remove radar vectoring and enable full CDOs.},

abstract = {Continuous descent operations (CDOs) with required times of arrival (RTA) have been identified as a potential solution for reducing the environmental footprint of aviation in the terminal maneuvering area without compromising capacity. This paper assesses the feasibility of replacing current air traffic control sequencing and merging techniques, mainly based on path stretching and air holding, by a control based on RTA over metering fixes on known and fixed arrival routes. Because the remaining distance to the runway threshold is always known by the aircraft crew, this would allow engine-idle CDOs that do not require speed-brake usage and where only elevator control is used to meet the RTA. The assessment has been performed for Barcelona-El Prat Airport (Spain) using historical traffic demand data. The earliest and latest trajectories at a metering fix for each inbound aircraft were computed assuming engine-idle CDOs. Given the attainable RTA window for each aircraft, the aircraft sequencing problem was solved. The results show that assigning RTA allows optimizing the landing sequence when air traffic is low. For scenarios with high-traffic loads and late RTA assignments, path stretching still was found to be necessary. The minimum distance from the runway where inbound aircraft should receive the RTA to fully remove any radar vectoring was also analyzed. It was demonstrated that the assignment of RTA well before starting the descent would favor to enable full CDOs.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a linear holding strategy based on prior works on cruise speed reduction, aimed at performing airborne delay at no extra fuel cost, as a complementary strategy to current ground and airborne holding strategies. Firstly, the equivalent speed concept is extended to climb and descent phases through an analysis of fuel consumption and speed from aircraft performance data. This gives an insight of the feasibility to implement the concept, differentiating the case where the cruise flight level initially requested is kept and the case where it can be changed before departure in order to maximize the linear holding time. Illustrative examples are given, where typical flights are simulated using an optimal trajectory generation tool where linear holding is maximized while keeping constant the initially planned fuel. Finally, the effects of linear holding are thoroughly assessed in terms of the vertical trajectory profiles, range of feasible speed intervals and trade-offs between fuel and time. Results show that the airborne delay increases significantly with nearly 3-fold time for short-haul flights and 2-fold for mid-hauls to the cases in prior works.},

abstract = {Continuous descent operations (CDO) with required times of arrival (RTAs) have been identified as a potential solution to reduce the environmental impact without compromising capacity. However, in high traffic scenarios RTAs may not suffice to maintain safe separation, and air traffic controllers may still need to use “open-loop vectors”, disabling CDOs by depriving on-board flight management systems of required knowledge about the remaining distance to go. This paper proposes to face peaks of traffic without using open-loop vectors by combining the assignment of RTAs and pre-defined routes, taking advantage of the flexibility that procedures such as the tromboning provide in the lateral domain. The concept is illustrated by means of a practical example using the tromboning procedure of the Frankfurt airport. For each possible shortcut of this tromboning, the feasible RTA windows for engine-idle CDOs and powered descents have been computed using numerical optimisation. Results show that time windows up to 10 minutes could be achieved with engine-idle CDOs. These time windows could be widened up to 18 minutes by allowing the use of thrust and speed-brakes, at the expense of burning more fuel and producing more noise. Results also demonstrate that, for a given RTA, very distinct shortcuts could be assigned such that the RTA fits into the associated feasible RTA window.},

A potential approach to improve the resolution and accuracy of the weather predictions could consist on using airborne aircraft as meteorological sensors, which would provide up-to-date weather observations to the surrounding aircraft and ground systems. This paper proposes to use Kriging, a geostatistical interpolation technique, to create short-term weather predictions from scattered weather observations derived from surveillance data. Results show that this method can accurately capture the spatio-temporal distribution of the temperature and wind fields, allowing to obtain high-quality local, short-term weather predictions and providing at the same time a measure of the uncertainty associated with the prediction.},

However, the time lag of recalculating the trajectory using traditional optimisation algorithms could lead to performance degradation and stability issues.

In this paper, an interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of short-term trajectory predictions. The active guidance mode of an aircraft is estimated in real-time observing flight data collected only from automatic dependent surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and transponder selective mode (Mode S) emissions. The algorithm is set up with different models corresponding to the most typical guidance modes, and provides the model that better fits the observations. The proposed algorithm is validated by means of two simulated trajectories whose guidance modes were known beforehand. Finally, the performance of the algorithm with real flight data is demonstrated through a detailed example. Promising results are obtained, showing that the active guidance mode can be unequivocally identified with a negligible delay.},

This paper assesses the feasibility of replacing the current air traffic control sequencing and merging techniques, which are mainly based on open-loop vectoring, by a control based on RTAs over known and pre-defined arrival routes (i.e., with known distances to go). An optimal control problem has been formulated and solved in order to generate CDO trajectories, while a mixed-integer-linear programming model was build in order to solve the aircraft landing problem in the metering fix. The assessment has been performed for Berlin-Sch{\"{o}}nefeld airport (Germany), by using arrival traffic gathered from historical data and by taking advantage of its tromboning procedure. Furthermore, a second scenario was studied by adding more simulated traffic to the existing one. Results show that, after assigning an RTA and a route to every arriving aircraft, a time separation of 120 is ensured in the metering fix, while at least 90 seconds of separation are maintained in the the rest of waypoints of the procedure.},

abstract = {The ability to meet a controlled time of arrival during a continuous descent operation will enable environmentally friendly and fuel efficient descent operations while simultaneously maintaining airport throughput. However, if the wind forecast used to compute the initial trajectory plan is not accurate enough, the guidance system will need to correct time deviations from the plan during the execution of the descent. Previous work proposed an on-board guidance strategy based on model predictive control, which repeatedly updates the trajectory plan in real-time from the current aircraft state and for the remainder of the descent. However, the wind conditions downstream, at altitudes not explored yet, were difficult to predict due to the lack of data. This paper shows the potential benefits of using wind observations, broadcast by nearby aircraft, to reconstruct the wind profile downstream. The wind profile in the trajectory optimization problem is modeled as a spline, which control points are updated to fit the observations before re-planning the trajectory. Results from simulations using realistic wind data show that the performance of model predictive control significantly improves when including up-to-date wind observations, in terms of time and energy errors at the metering fix and fuel consumption.},

abstract = {In this paper a set of new performance indicators (PIs) aiming to capture the environmental impact of aircraft operations is proposed. Its contribution is threefold: optimal trajectories are computed to compare them with historical trajectories and derive several flight efficiency PIs; a family of fuel-based PIs is proposed, where fuel is estimated only from surveillance trajectory datasets not requiring confidential data; and different PIs and variants are proposed aiming to decouple and to identify different sources of environmental inefficiencies, distinguishing those that could be attributed to the different layers of air traffic management (ATM), and those attributable to the airspace users (AUs). A case study is presented for two different days, where flight inefficiency was assessed with the proposed PIs for all traffic crossing the FABEC airspace during a 24h period. Main results show that average fuel inefficiencies that could be attributable to ATM are around 250 kg (7.8{\%}) when a full free route without en-route charges scenario at maximum range operations is considered as reference for the optimal trajectories. AUs induced fuel inefficiencies (due to flying faster than the maximum range speed) have a mean around 100 kg (3{\%}). It is also concluded that fuel inefficiencies in the vertical and horizontal trajectory domains have a similar contribution to the overall flight inefficiency. Yet, horizontal inefficiencies are higher at strategic level, while are negative at tactical level for the great majority of flights.},
