abstract = {Overloads (i.e., critical imbalances between traffic demand and capacity) are currently resolved in the European air transportation network by activating air traffic flow management regulations. Flights subject to regulations are delayed on the ground by the computer assisted slot allocation system, which uses a first-planned, first-served principle to allocate the delays. In the last decades, many researchers have proposed alternative models based on more or less complex optimisation techniques, which could effectively resolve overloads with less delay. Despite the fact that these models were very promising, changing the current operational system and procedures - which trust is supported by a successful working history dating back to 1995–may not be realistic in the short term. This paper examines the gradual transition from current air traffic flow management to a futuristic model in which flights are assigned delays with massive cherry-picking measures that minimise the total delay in the network, without necessarily adhering to the first-planned, first-served rule. A reference model with greedy regulations representative of current operations is compared to a model where the Network Manager optimises regulations using hyper-heuristics, a model based on massive cherry-picking measures, and hybrid models that consider regulations to resolve major overloads and cherry-picking measures only for residual overloads. These models are compared in critical scenarios with major capacity issues caused by adverse weather conditions. Results suggest that hybrid models could be a viable option for reducing delays with minor changes in the current air traffic flow management paradigm.}

abstract = {The ability to meet a controlled time of arrival while also flying a continuous descent operation will enable environmentally friendly and fuel efficient descent operations while simultaneously maintaining airport throughput. Previous work showed that model predictive control, a guidance strategy based on a reiterated update of the optimal trajectory during the descent, provides excellent environmental impact mitigation figures while meeting operational constraints in the presence of modeling errors. Despite that, the computational delay associated with the solution of the trajectory optimization problem could lead to performance degradation and stability issues. This paper proposes two guidance strategies based on the theory of neighboring extremals that alleviate this problem. Parametric sensitivities are obtained by linearization of the necessary conditions of optimality along the active optimal trajectory plan to rapidly update it for small perturbations, effectively converting the complex and time consuming non-linear programming problem into a manageable quadratic programming problem. Promising results, derived from more than 4000 simulations, show that the performance of this method is comparable to that of instantaneously recalculating the optimal trajectory at each time sample.},

abstract = {The vertical trajectory plan (altitude and speed) corresponding to the descent phase of a modern airliner is computed by the on-board flight management system  while the aircraft is still in cruise. As long as the constraints on the arrival procedure allow, this system plans for an idle descent and the exact location of the (optimal) top of descent (TOD) is determined in this process. In busy terminal airspace, however, air traffic control officers motivated by the needs to maintain a safe and expeditious flow of aircraft might require to start the descents before the TOD computed by each particular arriving aircraft. In such situations, most flight guidance systems aim to intercept the original altitude plan from below, by using a shallower descent angle while keeping the speed plan, requiring in this way, additional thrust. This leads, consequently, to higher fuel consumption figures. The objective of this paper is threefold. Firstly, it characterises and quantifies these fuel inefficiencies for an Airbus A320, using accurate aircraft performance data and a trajectory computation software from the manufacturer. Secondly, it proposes a methodology to automatically identify early descents and to extract the key parameters required to compute the fuel inefficiencies by only observing ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) data. Finally, the method is applied to a case study with 4,139 real ADS-B trajectories in Amsterdam-Schiphol (The Netherlands) terminal airspace; showing that early descents are very frequent and that they increase the fuel consumption by a 5{\

abstract = {In Europe, the most common air traffic flow management measure used by the network manager to resolve imbalances between demand and capacity is to impose regulations, which delay flights on ground. The ground delay assigned to a regulated flight may change from the time it is caught by the regulation(s) to the actual departure. This variability of the delay stems from the mechanisms used by the computer-assisted slot allocation system to manage the slots of the regulations. At present, the information on the delay evolution of a regulated flight is very limited for the airspace users, raising high uncertainty on the delay propagation and the operations management throughout the day. This paper describes the architecture of a machine learning model that, trained on historical data,is able predict the evolution of the delay for a regulated flight. Such evolution is expressed by using various indicators, which were selected by the airspace users involved in the project. The proposed model is able to predicted the trend of the delay with an accuracy of 0.75. Furthermore, results show that the model is able to reduce the prediction error (measured as the difference between the actual and the predicted delay) up to 63{\%}, if compared to the current delay as reported by the enhanced tactical flow management system.}

abstract = {Airport night curfews are restrictions applied at some airports that prohibit operations during certain hours of the night, aiming to reduce noise nuisance in the surrounding neighborhood. Despite effectively reducing noise exposure for local residents, these environmental measures can have negative economic and operational effects on the airspace user and the airport, as well as a negative experience for the passenger. This paper presents a model that, for each flight and well before the starting time of the curfew period, is able to provide the probability (risk) of night curfew infringement. The risk of night curfew infringement is computed from the start time of the restriction and the distribution of in-block times. The former is known for each airport, while the latter is provided by a neural network which was trained on historical data to predict the propagation of arrival delay along the sequence of flights of an aircraft. Results show that the model significantly improves the in-block time predictions, if compared to the current solution. Furthermore, the risk indicator could assist in identifying flights with potential risk of night curfew infringements within a reasonable time frame to implement effective mitigation actions.}

abstract={Air traffic control is performed in a centralised way by human controllers, which monitor and manage all aircraft flying through the airspace sector under their responsibility. Air traffic controllers give lateral (including heading and speed changes) or vertical instructions to ensure safe separation between aircraft, simultaneously trying to minimise deviations from the optimal trajectory plan. The continuous growth of air traffic before the COVID-19 crisis of 2020 bring up the matter of helping air traffic controllers in high-density traffic scenarios, where safety and flight efficiency cannot be compromised. Artificial intelligence has been proclaimed as successful to provide timely decision-support advice in many real-life applications that may be safety-critical. The recent advancements of reinforcement learning algorithms have been a key for many of these achievements. This paper presents a recommendation tool based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to support air traffic controllers in complex traffic scenarios. The policy function, which selects the \emph{best} actions to solve potential losses of separation, was trained by gathering experiences in a controlled simulation environment. The policy model, based on message passing neural networks, allows flights (agents) to exchange information through a communication protocol before proposing a joint action that promotes flight efficiency and penalises dangerous situations.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a collaborative air traffic flow management (ATFM) framework, in the scope of trajectory based operations, aiming to improve the cost-efficiency for airspace users (AUs) when facing ATFM regulations. The framework consists of four modules. The first one involves the AUs initially scheduling their preferred trajectories for all their flights. Based on this initial demand, the second module (assumed to be on the Network Manager -NM- side) detects time-varying hotspots (i.e. overloaded sectors along the day). In the third module, hotspot information is shared back to the AUs who plan alternative trajectory options to avoid crossing these congested airspace volumes (in the lateral and vertical domain); as well as providing to the NM different pre-tactical delay management preferences (including ground holding, linear holding, air holding and pre-tactical delay recovery); based on their internal cost breakdown structures. Incorporating all these potential combined options, the last module computes the best trajectory selections and the optimal distribution of delay assignments, such that the cost deviation from the initial status (all the user-preferred trajectories) is minimized. This model is formulated as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and validated by a real-world case study focused on 24 h of traffic over the French airspace. Results using the proposed framework suggest a significant system delay reduction by nearly 97% over the existing method, whilst yielding an average of less than 100 kg extra fuel consumption and 50 Euro extra route charges for the 11% flights diverted to their alternative trajectories.}

This paper assesses the accuracy of a method capable of producing aircraft fuel estimates based on their 4D trajectory timestamps and the weather forecast. Fuel consumption estimates generated for 2448 descents are compared with the flight data recorder (FDR) values provided by the airline. Fuel consumption is estimated by taking the 4D trajectory from two different sources: the FDR system itself and surveillance radar tracks. In both cases, the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) and a model that fits manufacturers' performance data to polynomial functions are used to represent aircraft performance. Results obtained with the later show that fuel usage could be estimated with an accuracy of 16 kg (4.8{\%}) by using the 4D trajectory as reported by the FDR system and 28 kg (7.8{\%}) by using surveillance radar observations. It is also observed that the BADA 3.6 model underestimates the fuel consumption, illustrating the need for an improved performance model in the terminal manoeuvring area. This method could be the cornerstone for the calculation of advanced performance indicators to measure flight efficiency (and environmental impact) in post-operational assessments, since it enables the estimation of the full state vector of an aircraft, including variables that are not explicitly included in the surveillance data (such the fuel, thrust, etc.).},

However, if the wind forecast used to compute the initial trajectory plan is not accurate enough, the guidance system will need to correct time deviations from the plan during the execution of the descent. Previous work proposed an on-board guidance strategy based on model predictive control, which repeatedly updates the trajectory plan in real-time from the current aircraft state and for the remainder of the descent. However, the wind conditions downstream, at altitudes not explored yet, were difficult to predict due to the lack of data. This paper shows the potential benefits of using wind observations, broadcast by nearby aircraft, to reconstruct the wind profile downstream. The wind profile in the trajectory optimization problem is modeled as a spline, which control points are updated to fit the observations before re-planning the trajectory. Results from simulations using realistic wind data show that the performance of model predictive control significantly improves when including up-to-date wind observations, in terms of time and energy errors at the metering fix and fuel consumption.},

The trajectories consider lateral re-routings and/or vertical avoidance of all detected hotspots, which, along with different types of delay measures (including linear holding and in-flight delay recovery), are then integrated as a whole into a centralized optimization model to manage the traffic flow under a set of static scheme of airspace capacities.

Considering that for short-haul flights the climb and descent phases usually account for a considerable percentage of the total trip distance, this paper extends previous works on speed reduction in cruise to the whole flight. A trajectory optimization software is used to compute the maximum airborne delay (or linear holding) that can be performed without extra fuel consumption if compared with the nominal flight. Three cases are studied: speed reduction only in cruise; speed reduction in the whole flight, but keeping the nominal cruise altitude; and speed reduction for the whole flight while also optimizing the cruise altitude to maximize delay. Three representative flights have been simulated, showing that the airborne delay increases significantly in the two last cases with nearly 3-fold time for short-haul flights and 2-fold for mid-hauls with the first case. Results also show that fuel and time are traded along different phases of flight in such a way the airborne delay is maximized while the total fuel burn is kept constant.},

The software architecture of the simulator, relying on a HPC cluster of computers, has been preliminary tested with a set of flights whose trajectory vertical profiles have been optimized according to two different concepts of operations: conventional cruise operations (i.e. flying at constant altitudes and according to the flight levels scheme rules) and continuous climb cruise operations (i.e., optimizing the trajectories with no vertical constraints). The novel ATM simulator has been tested to show preliminary benchmarking results between these two concepts of operations.

Optimal conventional tra-jectories (subject to realistic air traffic management practices and constraints) are compared with optimal continuous (and ideal) operations, only subject to aircraft performance constraints. Results show that the continuous cruise phase can lead to fuel savings between 1{\%} and 2{\%} of the total trip fuel for an Airbus A320. Interestingly, continuous operations show also a reduction of trip times between 1{\%} and 5{\%} of the total trip time, depending on the trip distance between origin and destination airports.},

abstract = {This paper describes a set of flight simulation experiments carried out with the DLR's Generic Cockpit Simulator (GECO). A new concept named time and energy managed operations (TEMO), which aims to enable advanced four dimensional (4D) continuous descent operations (CDO), was evaluated after three full days of experiments with qualified pilots. The experiment focused to investigate the possibility of using a 4D-controller on a modern aircraft with unmodified or only slightly modified avionic systems. This was achieved by executing the controller in an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) and using the pilot to 'close the loop' by entering speed and other advisories into the autopilot Flight Control Unit (FCU). The outcome of the experiments include subjective (questionnaires answered by pilots) and objective (trajectory logs) data. Data analysis showed a very good acceptance (both in terms of safety and operability of the procedure) from the participating crews, only with minor suggestions to be improved in future versions of the controller and the speed advisories update rates. Good time accuracy all along the descent trajectory was also observed.},

Firstly, the equivalent speed concept is extended to climb and descent phases through an analysis of fuel consumption and speed from aircraft performance data. This gives an insight of the feasibility to implement the concept, differentiating the case where the cruise flight level initially requested is kept and the case where it can be changed before departure in order to maximize the linear holding time. Illustrative examples are given, where typical flights are simulated using an optimal trajectory generation tool where linear holding is maximized while keeping constant the initially planned fuel. Finally, the effects of linear holding are thoroughly assessed in terms of the vertical trajectory profiles, range of feasible speed intervals and trade-offs between fuel and time. Results show that the airborne delay increases significantly with nearly 3-fold time for short-haul flights and 2-fold for mid-hauls to the cases in prior works.},

abstract = {Continuous descent operations (CDO) with required times of arrival (RTAs) have been identified as a potential solution to reduce the environmental impact without compromising capacity. However, in high traffic scenarios RTAs may not suffice to maintain safe separation, and air traffic controllers may still need to use “open-loop vectors”, disabling CDOs by depriving on-board flight management systems of required knowledge about the remaining distance to go. This paper proposes to face peaks of traffic without using open-loop vectors by combining the assignment of RTAs and pre-defined routes, taking advantage of the flexibility that procedures such as the tromboning provide in the lateral domain. The concept is illustrated by means of a practical example using the tromboning procedure of the Frankfurt airport. For each possible shortcut of this tromboning, the feasible RTA windows for engine-idle CDOs and powered descents have been computed using numerical optimisation. Results show that time windows up to 10 minutes could be achieved with engine-idle CDOs. These time windows could be widened up to 18 minutes by allowing the use of thrust and speed-brakes, at the expense of burning more fuel and producing more noise. Results also demonstrate that, for a given RTA, very distinct shortcuts could be assigned such that the RTA fits into the associated feasible RTA window.},

However, if the wind forecast used to compute the initial trajectory plan is not accurate enough, the guidance system will need to correct time deviations from the plan during the execution of the descent. Previous work proposed an on-board guidance strategy based on model predictive control, which repeatedly updates the trajectory plan in real-time from the current aircraft state and for the remainder of the descent. However, the wind conditions downstream, at altitudes not explored yet, were difficult to predict due to the lack of data. This paper shows the potential benefits of using wind observations, broadcast by nearby aircraft, to reconstruct the wind profile downstream. The wind profile in the trajectory optimization problem is modeled as a spline, which control points are updated to fit the observations before re-planning the trajectory.

Its contribution is threefold: optimal trajectories are computed to compare them with historical trajectories and derive several flight efficiency PIs; a family of fuel-based PIs is proposed, where fuel is estimated only from surveillance trajectory datasets not requiring confidential data; and different PIs and variants are proposed aiming to decouple and to identify different sources of environmental inefficiencies, distinguishing those that could be attributed to the different layers of air traffic management (ATM), and those attributable to the airspace users (AUs). A case study is presented for two different days, where flight inefficiency was assessed with the proposed PIs for all traffic crossing the FABEC airspace during a 24h period. Main results show that average fuel inefficiencies that could be attributable to ATM are around 250 kg (7.8{\%}) when a full free route without en-route charges scenario at maximum range operations is considered as reference for the optimal trajectories. AUs induced fuel inefficiencies (due to flying faster than the maximum range speed) have a mean around 100 kg (3{\%}). It is also concluded that fuel inefficiencies in the vertical and horizontal trajectory domains have a similar contribution to the overall flight inefficiency. Yet, horizontal inefficiencies are higher at strategic level, while are negative at tactical level for the great majority of flights.},
